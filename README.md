<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<h2>Hello World :earth_americas:!</h2>


My name is [**Flavio Akira**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flavio-akira/?locale=en_US).
I am a Data Analyst student at Southern Alberta Institute of Technology - SAIT and bachelor in Economics. I strongly believe that using data-driven we can help businesses to move forward. Once you put together ideas and knowing the correct questions to be made as ‚Äì what I really need? How can I improve? what Can I change? and etc. You are able to capture data accurately and prepare an analysis. Resulting in a clean, organized, and understandable data presentation. 
In 2017, I have moved to Canada. Looking for a fresh and new starting, I have engaged myself in the data world, and now, after setting up in Calgary. I felt the motivation needed to explore and learn more about Data Analysis.

<p>A few interesting facts about me. 

- Moving to this new city and living so close to Rocky Mountains I can tell I have felt in love with hiking and I am grateful for this connection to the nature. 

- On my free time, I like to play competitive strategy games as Moba games. 

- I challenge and push myself to at least learn one new thing every day, getting out of the comfort doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. 
That is why I decided to change my career to the technology field. I started learning data analyst/science with machine learning, SQL, Python, Math, and Statistical Methods. As a hobby; I have started programing in Javascript and developing in CSS and HTML.</p>
